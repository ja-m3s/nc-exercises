/*Finally, you will need a way to battle the Pokemon. 
The battle should take two trainers and the names of the Pokemon they wish to battle.
Methods

fight

    This should take the Pokemon whose turn it is,
    Attack the defending Pokemon (deducting attacker's attack damage from the defender's hit points)
    End their turn
    Should take each Pokemon's strengths and weaknesses into account
    If a defender is strong against the attacking type, the attacking type's damage should be multiplied by 0.75.
    If a defender is weak against the attacking type, the attacking type's damage should be multiplied by 1.25.
    Each attack should be followed by an attack message
    The message will vary depending on the defender's weakness/strength.
    If the defending Pokemon faints (depletes all hit points), the attacker wins.

This is quite a complex method, and you may want to break up some of its behaviour into additional methods so you can make it tidier. 
You may also want to create additional properties, if you think these will be helpful. */
