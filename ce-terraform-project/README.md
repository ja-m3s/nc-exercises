# Terraform project

![A hero starting their journey looking at a tower](./media/images/journey.png "A hero starting their journey looking at a tower")

It is time to take those Terraform skills you have been developing and create your own project.

Time to start your journey and create a brand new Terraform project from scratch. You know on the journey there will be challenges, that battle with your arch enemy "remote state", the boss fight of "sso authentication" but you are more than capable - you got this!

You can find the trello board to copy for your project below

## Requirements

The target destination for this project is that you should be able to visit a website and see a HTML page that can be customised as much as you like but it should have the statement "Terraform Provisioned Me" somewhere on the page.

But that isn't everything....

We want this to be production ready so your solution should have

- Completed using terraform
- A production ready network setup with both public and private subnets YES
- Utilise remote state for storing the terraform state YES
- Make use of terraform variables and looping where required YES
- Make your code as DRY and reusable as possible by creating modules YES
- The HTML page must be served by back an NGINX web server YES
- The NGINX web server must reside within EC2 instances that are within the public subnet YES
- The NGINX web server should respond on port 80 YES
- You should design for failure - we do not want a loss of service if one of the EC2 instances fails
- Be considerate and intentional of how your files and directory structures are named
- A comprehensive **INSTRUCTIONS.md** file that provide instructions on how to use the repository and how to get things working

Having to understand software that you might not have come across, such as NGINX in this scenario, is part of being a cloud engineer. You will experience development teams creating apps in all different languages and approaches - you have to work out how to get them deployed so this exercise is the perfect preparation to try and work that out.

Another big part of your job as a cloud engineer, is communication. You will often work with people from various parts of the company with varying levels of understanding, but ultimately they all need to understand what you are proposing or doing. Make a file called `INSTRUCTIONS.md` and after each ticket, write a small walkthrough of the code you have written in easy to understand language. This should include things like instructions on how to use the code you have written, what it does, and how it achieves this. For example;

```
The VPC module will create x, y, and z resources. This will create a VPC to house all of the resources we will create from here on out, etc.

The variables required are as follows;

availability_zones - list(string)
A list of availability zones you wish to provision resources in.
```

## Tearing things down

You should run `terraform destroy` to remove everything.

**üóíÔ∏è Note:** When using remote state sometimes the terraform destroy has a problem trying to remove your S3 bucket and DynamoDB table. if you experience this issue you can manually delete them using the AWS console.

## Submission process

1. Fork this GitHub repository

2. Make regular commits and pushes back to your repository after each ticket. It help us to see the journey you worked through when completing the task.

3. After each ticket when asked, update your `INSTRUCTIONS.MD`.

4. Share your GitHub Commit Link to `/nchelp pr` for a code review

5. Tear things down as described above
