## Extension exercise

You'll have noticed that the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for your website isn't very memorable. It is a little long.

Try to put together written answers for the questions below.

Which AWS service might you use to create your own domain name? Something more memorable and shorter such as "cloud-engineering.com"

**Route 53**

When using that service what will you need to configure in order to "point" it at your S3 bucket website?

**A DNS, and modify DNS tags, probably A, AAAA for IPV6, maybe MX if it's a mail server (amongst others)**

üóíÔ∏è Note: You should not buy anything at this stage just research the topic and put together your own notes as if you were going to buy and configure your own domain.

üí° Hint: If you need a hint, have a research around DNS services within AWS
